# ALX Software Engineering Printf Team Project

## Description

This team project is a custom made printf function for the C programming language called _printf. It has been optimized to take various inputs and optional arguments based exactly on how the standard library function printf works. We submitted this as part of the ALX software engineering course requirement for grading.

## Prototype
`int_printf(const char *format, ...);`

## Format of the format string
The format string is a character string starting and ending with double quotes. The format string is composed of zero or more directives; ordinary characters (not %), and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

Each conversion specification is introduced by the character % and ends with a conversion specifier.
